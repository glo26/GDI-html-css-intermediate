GDI HTML CSS Intermediate, Cville Parody 1.0: The Portfolio of Mr. Roy G. Biv (instead of the zebra)

This project was created due to a self-participatory sessions with the GDI group - Girl Develop It.
It's a gift for @hmoco and crew, because they taught the class!

So why "Mr. Roy G. Biv"?<br>
Just for fun. It's basically colors personified.

Meet Mr. Roy G. Biv:
