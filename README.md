GDI HTML CSS Intermediate, Cville Parody 1.0: The Portfolio of Mr. Roy G. Biv (instead of the zebra)

# So, what is this all about?
This project was created due to a self-participatory sessions with the GDI group - Girl Develop It.
It's a gift for @hmoco and crew, because they taught the class!

So why "Mr. Roy G. Biv"?<br>
Just for fun. It's basically colors personified.

# And why should I care about GDI?
Who runs the world? Girls. Girls.

I will also try to do the other workshops and have it nested under a repo here on https://github.com/glo26
