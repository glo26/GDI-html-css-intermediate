            	<h4>My Family</h4>
            				<p>I have been married for 20 years. My kids are now all grown-ups. Oh, and by the way, I have 7 of them. They are as follows: 1) Red, 2) Orange, 3) Yellow, 4) Green, 5) Blue, 6) Indigo, and 7) Violet. Violet is my favorite. She's amazingly smart and humble at the same time. Highly remarkable. I call them all at once usually by saying "RAINBOW." Yes, they all come.</p>

I literally add colors to an otherwise boring world. Whether you're color-blind or not, I still am needed. Hire me now in your code, design, startup, and more! :) </p>
